**_I’m a passionate experienced graphic & web designer. I love solving creative challenging problems while making them look beautiful and functional._**


I’ve been designing across many different mediums for over five years. My experience has been mostly in fast-paced creative agencies specializing in digital and print projects. During this time I’ve become thirsty about web design and development. Currently, I focus on digital projects and have a firm understanding of modern web technologies. My goals are to continue learning front end languages such as HTML, CSS, & JS with the aspirations of becoming a front end developer.
