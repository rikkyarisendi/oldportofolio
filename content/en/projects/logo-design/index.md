**Here my current works**

Working with a variety of clients designing logo, websites, printed material, and identities. Being a freelance designer has been very rewarding and I‚Äôve learned a ton about communication, budgeting, and managing expectations. Although tough to balance a full time job and freelancing on the side I enjoy the challenge. Freelancing has opened many doors and I‚Äôve met many talented goal driven people. My favorite part of freelancing is seeing clients excited about their project and wanting to continue pushing for more great design. üëç
